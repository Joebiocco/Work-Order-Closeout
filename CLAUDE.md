# CLAUDE.md — Field Tools Project Context

> ## 🚨 CLAUDE: READ THIS FILE FIRST 🚨
>
> Before reading any HTML file or making any change to this project, **read this entire file**. It is the authoritative reference for:
> - Where things live (file paths, storage keys, DB names)
> - The design system (colors, tokens, animations)
> - What NOT to touch (PDF code, storage keys, certain constants)
> - User preferences and conventions (commit style, increment rules, naming)
>
> **This file exists to save tokens.** Re-reading the four HTML files (~6,800 lines total) for every change is wasteful. Use this reference first; only read source files when you need specifics this file doesn't cover.
>
> ## 🔄 KEEP THIS FILE CURRENT
>
> Every time you make a change to the project, **update the corresponding section of this file in the same commit**. The file is only useful if it stays accurate. If you add a storage key, a CSS class, an animation, or change a behaviour — reflect it here. If you remove or invert a behaviour — remove or invert the note.
>
> ## ✋ ASK BEFORE PUSHING
>
> The user prefers an explicit confirmation before `git push`. After committing locally, **ask "Push?" or similar** before running `git push`. Only when the user confirms, bump the version stamp (footer + service-worker cache) and push.
>
> **Version bump rule:** decimal increments only (v1.0 → v1.1 → v1.2). Never whole-number jumps. Only bump immediately before a push — don't bump on every commit.

## 1. Project Overview

A static internal PWA for NJ DOT field workers, hosted on GitHub Pages. **No backend.** Five current tools + two placeholder tiles for upcoming features.

**Audience:** NJ DOT field workers using phones and tablets in the field, plus desktop in the office.

**Critical constraints (DO NOT VIOLATE):**
- **DO NOT TOUCH the PDF programming** in `pages/WorkOrderCloseout.html` (uses `html2canvas` + `jspdf`). This was an explicit user constraint from project start.
- **DO NOT clear or rename localStorage/IndexedDB keys** listed below. Doing so destroys user bookmarks, saved work-order sessions, and photos.
- **DO NOT introduce dependencies** that require a backend or build step. The site must be pure static HTML/CSS/JS.

**Geolocation behaviour (current — do not break):**
- Fuel finder **auto-fetches location on page load** if `navigator.permissions.query({name:'geolocation'}).state === 'granted'`. First-time visitors still see the button so the permission prompt only fires on their click. After the prompt is granted once, subsequent visits are silent.
- Bridge navigator's "Find Near Me" pill stays manual (single-purpose locator, not a continuous discovery feature).
- NEVER cache the lat/lng in localStorage with a TTL — workers may be moving and need a fresh fix every time.

### Bridge source data

- `data/bridges/index.json` is the Bridge Navigator startup/search/GPS/bookmark index.
- `data/bridges/chunks/by-county/*.json` holds complete original full bridge records for detail panels, copy/share fields, selected bookmark details, and selected GPS details.
- `data/njstructures.json` remains the Bridge Navigator source archive and fallback data file only.
- Current source shape: `{ metadata: { recordCount, generatedDate, source }, records: [...] }`.
- Current local size is about 12.4 MB; `pages/njsearch.html` is about 541 KB after removing inline bridge records.
- `records[].Structure_Number` preserves the exact raw value and remains the stable key for bookmarks, search, and future data migration.
- `ft_bridge_bookmarks` must remain an array of raw `Structure_Number` values. Do not store formatted `XXXX-XXX` values there and do not migrate/rename the key.
- Normal Bridge Navigator startup loads `../data/bridges/index.json` through `loadBridgeIndex()` and stores lightweight records in `bridgeIndex`.
- `bridgeIndexByStructureNumber` maps raw `Structure_Number` values to index records for search, bookmarks, and GPS matching.
- Bridge Navigator search uses strict bridge-number scoring for numeric/dash queries (no fuzzy/subsequence matching), while general text queries still support bridge name, county, route, municipality, facility carried, and feature crossed fields from the statewide index.
- Search result map pins use lightweight index records only. Result sets over 50 pins are capped to the first 50 by default and expose a quiet in-map "Map: 50 of X / Show all" control for broad county/route searches.
- The Bridge Navigator "All Bridges" filter renders the statewide index list without loading all county chunks; it uses the same 50-pin map cap and only lazy-loads the selected bridge's full county chunk.
- Find Near Me / GPS bridge lookup must scan the statewide `bridgeIndex`; do not load county chunks to determine nearest GPS candidates.
- Full bridge records live in `data/bridges/chunks/by-county/*.json` and are lazy-loaded with `getFullBridgeRecord()` only when a bridge detail/share/copy view needs full fields.
- `bridgeChunkCache` caches loaded county chunk promises in memory; chunks are not stored in localStorage or IndexedDB.
- `data/njstructures.json` is loaded only by fallback code if the index cannot be loaded.
- `pages/njsearch.html` no longer embeds `BRIDGES_DATA`; do not re-inline bridge records.
- `service-worker.js` pre-caches `data/bridges/index.json`; county chunks are runtime-cached after first fetch. Do not pre-cache every county chunk unless explicitly approved.

## 3. Storage Architecture

### localStorage keys

| Key | File(s) | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ft_bridge_bookmarks` | njsearch | `JSON.stringify(["structNum1", "structNum2"])` | Array of bookmarked Structure_Number strings |
| `ft_fuel_bookmarks` | njfuel | `JSON.stringify(["lat,lng", ...])` | Composite coord keys via `_fuelKey(s)` helper |
| `wo_recent` | WorkOrderCloseout | JSON array (max 5) of recent session metadata | Each rec has `{wo, str, date, fname, route, direction, mp, startDate, endDate, priority, photoKey}` — PHOTOS NOT INCLUDED HERE |
| `workorder_draft` | WorkOrderCloseout | Full session JSON snapshot | Single auto-saved draft |
| `ft_dc144_recent` | dc144 | JSON array (max 5) of recent DC-144 session metadata | Each rec has `{id, tab, projectName, date, savedAt, photoKey}` — full data in IDB |
| `ft_dc144_templates` | dc144 | JSON array (max 10) of saved templates | Each entry has `{id, name, createdAt, header:{projectName,contractId,contractor,inspectorName}}` — header-only, no grid rows |
| `field_dark_mode` | all pages | `"1"` if dark mode on | Theme preference |
| `ft_last` | all pages | `"njsearch" \| "njfuel" \| "closeout" \| "milemarker" \| "timesheet" \| "dc144"` | Last visited tool (used for the Home recent badge and Continue section) |
| `ft_install_shown` | index | int 0-2 | How many times install popup has auto-shown on mobile |
| `ft_bookmark_shown` | index | int 0-2 | How many times bookmark popup has auto-shown on desktop |

### sessionStorage keys (cleared on tab close)

| Key | Set by | Read by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ft_opening_from_hub` | hub click on tool card | tool page head inline script | Triggers slide-in-from-left animation |
| `ft_returning_to_hub` | hub-back click + browser back | hub head inline script + pageshow | Triggers slide-in-from-right animation |

### IndexedDB

**Database:** `ft_photos` (v2) — v1 created by WorkOrderCloseout.html; v2 upgrade performed by dc144.js when the DC-144 page first opens.

**Object store:** `session_photos` (v1) — key is `photoKey` from wo_recent rec.

**Object store:** `dc144_sessions` (v2) — key is `photoKey` from ft_dc144_recent rec. Full session JSON including photos.

**Value structure:**
```js
{
  photos:     Array<Array<{ src, location, description }>>,  // [pageIndex][photoIndex]
  pageData:   Array<{ [data-base attribute]: value }>,        // per-page form data
  pageCount:  number,                                          // how many pages were in this session
  isCloseout: boolean                                          // closeout document toggle state
}
```

**Helper functions in WorkOrderCloseout.html:**
- `openPhotoDB()` — opens/caches IDB connection
- `dbPutPhotos(key, data)` — write
- `dbGetPhotos(key)` — read
- `dbDeletePhotos(key)` — delete on session eviction

**Helper functions in js/dc144.js** (same IDB database, separate store):
- `openPhotoDB()` — same name, bumps to v2, adds `dc144_sessions` if needed
- `dbPutDC144(key, data)` — writes to `dc144_sessions`
- `dbGetDC144(key)` — reads from `dc144_sessions`
- `dbDeleteDC144(key)` — called on session eviction from `ft_dc144_recent`

**Important:** When a session is evicted from `wo_recent` (capped at 5), `dbDeletePhotos(rec.photoKey)` is called to free the IDB entry. The `photoKey` is `'pk_' + Date.now()` set at save time.

**Important:** `ft_photos` v2 `onupgradeneeded` checks `oldVersion` to add stores incrementally — it never recreates `session_photos`. WorkOrderCloseout.html sessions are fully safe when the DC-144 page triggers the v1→v2 upgrade.

## 4. Design System

### Color tokens (CSS custom properties)

```css
:root {
  --bg: #eef0f4;          /* page background, light */
  --surface: #ffffff;     /* cards/panels */
  --border: #d1d9e0;
  --border-lo: #e8ecf0;   /* subtle borders */
  --accent: #1a56db;      /* primary blue — buttons, links, focus */
  --accent-lo: rgba(26,86,219,0.08);
  --red: #dc2626;
  --text: #111827;
  --muted: #6b7280;
  --muted2: #4b5563;
  --radius-sm: 5px; --radius: 8px; --radius-lg: 10-12px;
  --sans: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, Arial, sans-serif;
  --transition: 0.14s ease;
}
html[data-dark] {
  --bg: #0f1117; --surface: #1c1e26; --border: #2d3748;
  --border-lo: #1f2937; --text: #f1f5f9; --muted: #94a3b8;
  --muted2: #cbd5e1; --accent-lo: rgba(26,86,219,0.15);
}
```

### Brand / Accent palette (NOT in CSS vars — hardcoded throughout)

| Role | Light mode hex | Dark mode hex | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Header accent** | `#E5B33B` (saffron gold) | same | Topbar bottom border, hub-back pill, dark toggle, install trigger |
| Header accent hover | `#C9971A` | `#FEE9A1` | Deeper warm gold |
| Topbar background | `#1e2939` (dark navy) | same | Always dark, never themed |
| Bookmark stars / "favorite" | `#f59e0b` (amber-500) | same | Universal star color — DO NOT change to header accent |
| Bridge Navigator card | `#7c3aed` (purple) | `#a78bfa` | `card-border-purple`, `card-icon-purple`, `tag-nj` |
| Fuel Station card | `#10b981` / `#059669` | same | `card-border-green`, `card-icon-green`, `tag-fuel` |
| Work Order card | `#64748b` / `#475569` | same | `card-border-slate`, `card-icon-slate`, `tag-doc` |
| DC-144 Field Form card | `#4338ca` (indigo) | `#818cf8` | `card-border-indigo`, `card-icon-indigo`, `tag-dc` |
| Find Near Me pill | `#0d9488` (teal) | `#2dd4bf` | On njsearch.html, distinct from cards |
| Coming Soon — Drainage | `#0891b2` (cyan) | `#67e8f9` | `card-icon-cyan`, `card-border-cyan` |
| Coming Soon — Milemarker | `#b45309` / `#d97706` (warm amber) | `#fcd34d` | Safety/warning theme. `card-icon-amber-soon` |
| Coming Soon — Emergency | `#be123c` (rose) | `#fb7185` | `card-icon-rose`, `card-border-rose` |
| Condition: Good / Open | `#22c55e` / `#16a34a` | — | Map markers, badges |
| Condition: Poor / Closed | `#dc2626` / `#9ca3af` | — | |

### Color change procedure

When asked to change the **header accent color**, sweep all hex variants together (use python script). Don't just change one — there are typically 80-120 references across the 4 pages in:
- Topbar border-bottom (2px line)
- `.hub-back`, `.topbar-back` pill and hover
- `.dark-toggle` background/border/color
- `.install-trigger` hover
- `.install-banner` border-top
- Theme-color meta tag (in `<head>`)
- `manifest.json` `theme_color` field
- Various focus rings, info badges, etc.

**DO NOT touch the following during accent sweeps:**
- Bookmark stars (`.bookmark-btn`, `.fuel-bookmark-btn`, `.is-bookmarked` markers) — always amber `#f59e0b`
- Coming Soon Milemarker tile — always warm amber
- Card border/icon colors for the 3 main tools (purple/green/slate)
- The `--accent: #1a56db` deep blue (used for buttons/links, NOT the header)

---

## 5. Animation System

### Global animation classes (applied to `<html>`)

| Class | Set by | Triggers | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `theme-transitioning` | dark mode toggle click | Crossfade all bg/color/border properties site-wide | 420ms, cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1) |
| `exiting-to-tool` | hub tool-card click | Body slides right + fades | 260ms exit, navigate at 180ms |
| `entering-from-hub` | tool page head inline script (reads sessionStorage) | Body slides in from left, scale 0.98→1 | 380ms, cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) |
| `exiting-to-hub` | tool's hub-back click + popstate | Body slides left + fades | 360ms exit, navigate at 280ms |
| `returning-from-tool` | hub head inline script + pageshow | Body slides in from right, scale 0.98→1 | 460ms, cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) |

### Anti-flicker pattern

Every transition animation class has the FROM state set explicitly via direct CSS properties (`opacity`, `transform`) on the selector — NOT just keyframes — so the body is guaranteed to be in the correct off-screen state before the animation actually starts. Pattern:

```css
@keyframes slideInFromLeft {
  0%   { opacity: 0; transform: translate3d(-18vw, 0, 0) scale(0.98); }
  100% { opacity: 1; transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) scale(1); }
}
html.entering-from-hub body {
  opacity: 0;                                       /* lock start state */
  transform: translate3d(-18vw, 0, 0) scale(0.98);  /* lock start state */
  animation: slideInFromLeft 380ms cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) both !important;
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

### Smart header (sticky topbar with hide-on-scroll)

Each page has:
```css
.topbar, #topbar {
  position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 600;
  /* z-index must be ABOVE .recent-overlay (500) so blur doesn't cover topbar */
  transition: transform 460ms cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1), opacity 460ms ...;
}
.topbar.header-hidden { transform: translateY(-100%); opacity: 0; pointer-events: none; }
```

JS behavior (in every page):
- Scroll down past 80px → after 1s of sustained downscroll → add `header-hidden`
- Scroll up → remove `header-hidden` immediately
- Mouse near top (clientY ≤ 14) → reveal
- Touch near top (clientY ≤ 30) → reveal (mobile)
- Mouse hovering over topbar → never hide (`mouseOverHeader` flag)

### Other key animations

- **Page fade-in (body)**: `pageFadeIn 460ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — default body load animation, OVERRIDDEN by `entering-from-hub` / `returning-from-tool` via `!important`
- **Photo pop-in (work order)**: 420ms easeOutExpo on `.drop-preview.active`
- **Page block fade-in**: `blockFadeIn 520ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` on `.page-block`
- **Page remove**: `pageRemoveFade 380ms cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)` followed by height collapse
- **Result/station stagger**: `nth-child` delays 50-60ms between items
- **Toast in/out**: `transform/opacity 240-280ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`
- **Button click glow**: `btnGlow 320ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — soft outer pulse via box-shadow
- **Button tap scale**: `transform: scale(0.96) !important; transition: transform 80ms ease-out !important;` on `:active`

### Standard easing curves used

- `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — easeOutExpo — luxury entrances
- `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` — easeOutQuint — gentle settle
- `cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)` — easeInOutCubic — symmetric navigation
- `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` — Material standard — exits

## 6. PWA / Service Worker

### Caching strategy

```js
const CACHE = 'ft-v1.11-2026-05-21';  // BUMP this on every push that should force refresh

// HTML pages → NETWORK-FIRST (always latest, cache as offline fallback)
// Static files (icons, JSON, manifest) → CACHE-FIRST (rarely change)
// CDN libs (Leaflet, html2canvas, jsPDF, Inter font) → NETWORK-FIRST with cache fallback
```

**Important:** The service worker cache is **completely separate** from localStorage and IndexedDB. Updating/clearing the SW cache does NOT touch user bookmarks, sessions, or photos.

### Update protocol

**Only when actually pushing to GitHub** (not on every commit):
1. Ask user for confirmation first ("Push?" / "Ready to push?")
2. On confirmation: bump `CACHE` constant in `service-worker.js` (e.g., `ft-v1.1-2026-05-18` → `ft-v1.2-2026-05-18`)
3. Bump version stamp in `index.html` footer (decimal increment only)
4. Bump "Last updated" date in `CLAUDE.md`
5. `git push` → GitHub Pages auto-deploys

Existing users get the new SW on their next visit; old cache is auto-deleted on activate. **localStorage and IndexedDB are NOT touched by SW cache changes** — user bookmarks/sessions/photos persist.

---

## 7. Critical UI Patterns

### Standard map frame

- Leaflet maps should use the Bridge Navigator framed-map treatment unless a task explicitly says otherwise.
- Standard map frame: equal spacing on all sides (`12px` desktop, `10px` mobile), `14px` desktop radius, `12px` mobile radius, `overflow:hidden`, token border, light-mode soft shadow, darker dark-mode shadow, and neutral `#e8ecf0` loading background.
- The map frame element itself owns the border/radius/shadow/overflow. Do not put a rounded map inside an extra padded transparent card; that creates inconsistent map width and spacing.
- On stacked tablet/mobile layouts, map frames should align to the same page edge rhythm as the primary content (`10px` side spacing at the current 656px test width). Use a `max-width:720px`-style breakpoint when needed, not only narrow phone breakpoints.
- Keep map controls inside the rounded clipped frame. Place auxiliary map UI as quiet in-map controls when possible instead of large notices above/below the map.
- After changing map container spacing or dimensions, call/keep existing `invalidateSize()` behavior where the page already uses it and test desktop, tablet-width, and phone-width layouts.

### Bookmark system (bridges + fuel stations)

Two parallel implementations, identical behavior:

**Bridge bookmarks (njsearch.html):**
- Storage: `localStorage["ft_bridge_bookmarks"]` = array of `Structure_Number` strings
- Helpers: `getBookmarks()`, `setBookmarks()`, `isBookmarked(structNum)`, `toggleBookmark(structNum)`
- UI: "Save"/"Saved" pill button on bridge detail panel header, star `.bookmark-filter` button at top of search area
- Filter mode: `bookmarkFilterOn` boolean — when true, doSearch shows only bookmarked bridges sorted by insertion order

**Fuel bookmarks (njfuel.html):**
- Storage: `localStorage["ft_fuel_bookmarks"]` = array of `lat.toFixed(5)+","+lng.toFixed(5)` keys
- Helpers: `_fuelKey(s)`, `getFuelBookmarks()`, `setFuelBookmarks()`, `isFuelBookmarked(key)`, `toggleFuelBookmarkClick(btnEl)`
- UI: Circle bookmark button at **bottom-right of each station card** (in `.coords-row`), star pill in own labeled `.bookmark-card` box that sits after the Google My Maps line
- Filter mode: `fuelBookmarkFilterOn` boolean — `toggleFuelBookmarkFilter()` shows bookmarked stations sorted by **Open first → Hours-Vary → Closed**, then by distance/name within each group
- Empty state shown if no bookmarks
- Scrolls to bookmark card after location is found (double-rAF + manual scroll math with 70px top offset)

### Work Order Closeout session system

- Multi-page document (`.page-block` elements in `#pagesContainer`)
- Each page has up to N photo cards with file inputs (camera + gallery)
- "Recent sessions" panel (top-right) shows last 5 saved sessions
- Save flow: collect photos → store full snapshot to IDB with `photoKey` → save metadata to `wo_recent` localStorage (no photos in localStorage)
- Restore flow on chip click: read `wo_recent` rec, fetch IDB snapshot by `photoKey`, restore page count + per-page text fields + photos
- Per-page text fields keyed by `data-base` attribute (NOT `el.name` which includes page-number suffix that breaks on rebuild)

### Find Near Me / GPS bridge lookup (njsearch.html)

- Floating teal pill, fixed bottom-right
- On click: `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` (always fresh, no caching)
- GPS candidate matching scans the lightweight statewide `bridgeIndex`, not county chunks.
- Per-bridge dynamic radius: `max(50m, structure_length_m + 40m GPS buffer)` — accounts for NBI coords being at one approach end
- 0 matches → empty state with distance to nearest bridge
- 1 match → auto-opens detail
- Multiple matches → bottom-sheet picker sorted by distance
- Distances always in US units (ft / mi)
- Opening a search result, bookmark, or GPS-selected bridge lazy-loads the selected bridge's full county chunk before rendering copy/share/full detail fields.

### Fuel Station Finder

- Locate button always visible. First label is "Find Near Me"; after a successful lookup it becomes "Refresh Location".
- ALWAYS requests fresh location (no localStorage cache — users may be moving)
- Map uses `fuelMap.invalidateSize()` after location + 350ms delay (mobile layout shift fix)
- "Hide Closed" toggle on results header — label dynamic ("Show Closed" when hidden)
- Tooltip on station pin: dark-navy themed, `pointer-events: none`, offset `-36px` so it doesn't cover other pins
- Active station tooltip auto-opens on `highlightStation()`

### Road Milepost Finder

- Data source is preprocessed from the master CSV into `data/mileposts/`.
- Runtime data may include multiple route subtypes, but UI matching is intentionally filtered by mode.
- `State / US / Interstate` mode prefers mainline Interstate (`ROUTE_SUBT=1`), US Route (`2`), NJ State Highway (`3`), and Authority/Parkway/Expressway (`4`) records. Ramp, connector, and secondary-looking records only win when the user is very close and no mainline point is nearby enough.
- `County Routes` mode matches County Route (`ROUTE_SUBT=5`) records only.
- Runtime does **not** load statewide data at once: first fetch `data/mileposts/index.json`, then fetch only nearby tile chunks from `data/mileposts/chunks/*.json` based on GPS tile + neighbors.
- Nearest lookup uses Haversine distance across loaded points and returns route class, route name, SRI, milepost, cross street, and distance.
- Map layer stack matches Bridge/Fuel tools: Google Street (`lyrs=m`) + Google Satellite (`lyrs=y`) with Leaflet layer toggle.

### DC-144 Field Form

- **Source files:** `pages/dc144.html` (shell + CSS) + `js/dc144.js` (all logic)
- **CDN dependency:** ExcelJS v4.4.0 via `cdn.jsdelivr.net` — used for client-side .xlsx generation
- **Session isolation:** Each session is tied to exactly one tab (a/b/c/d). `tab` field is the discriminator.
- **Row caps per tab:** a=17, b=19, c=18, d=24. `addGridRow()` disables add button when limit reached.
- **Remarks fields:** Single unified `<textarea>` per remarks region, not line-by-line row inputs.
- **Photo appendix:** Photos are written to a separate 'Photo Appendix' worksheet only; never injected inline into data cells. Remarks text gets `[See Photo Appendix — Photo N]` markers. Photo row height is calculated from stored `widthPx`/`heightPx` to preserve aspect ratio (column 60 chars wide ≈ 450pts; height clamped 100–450pts).
- **Template:** `data/dc144-template.xlsx` — must be created manually from the original XLS. Export falls back to a minimal workbook if 404.
- **Image compression:** Canvas → 1400px max long side → JPEG 0.72 → fallback 0.58. Target ≤200KB per photo. Stores `widthPx`/`heightPx` in photo object for aspect ratio export.
- **ExcelJS cell addressing:** All uses `ws.getCell(row, col)` with 1-based row/col from `DC144_CELL_MAP`.
- **IDB store:** `dc144_sessions` in `ft_photos` v2. Key = `photoKey` from `ft_dc144_recent` rec.
- **Auto-save:** 2000ms debounce on `input`/`change` events. Writes full session JSON to IDB + updates `ft_dc144_recent` chip. Status indicator: "Saving…" → "Draft Saved" (clears after 3s) in `#autosave-status` span.
- **Filename pattern:** `DC-144-[TAB]-[YYYYMMDD]-[SafeProjectName].xlsx`
- **Tab color palette:** a=indigo `#4338ca`, b=amber `#92400e`, c=teal `#0e7490`, d=rose `#9f1239`
- **Template system:** `ft_dc144_templates` localStorage key (max 10). "Save as Template" button in form actionbar saves header fields only (projectName, contractId, contractor, inspectorName). "Load" shows tab-picker overlay then starts a new session with header pre-populated. Templates rendered in dashboard "Your Templates" section.
- **Unit dropdowns (Tab A):** Placed Qty and As Built Qty columns use `type:'qty-unit'` — renders `.qty-cell-wrap` with number input + unit select (SF/LF/SY/TONS/CY/UNIT/LS/Custom) + custom text input (shown only when Custom selected). Export concatenates: `"450 SY"`, `"1 LS"`, `"12 BNDL"` etc.
- **Dark mode:** Page ONLY reads `field_dark_mode` from localStorage at load — never writes it. No local dark toggle exists on this page.
- **Navigation:** Topbar back button always shows "Home" (house icon). Form actionbar "← Back" returns to dashboard without page navigation. Topbar back from dashboard triggers `exiting-to-hub` animation then navigates to `../index.html`.
- **Sticky actionbar gap fix:** `#form-actionbar` top CSS transitions between `var(--topbar-h)` (topbar visible) and `0px` (topbar hidden) via `initSmartHeader()` → `updateActionbarTop()`.
- **Excel borders:** `applyDataRowBorders()` applies thin gray borders to all grid data rows after patching. `applyRemarksMerges()` programmatically merges remarks zones (try/catch safe against pre-existing merges from template).

### Hub install/bookmark popup

- **Mobile:** auto-shows bottom banner up to 2 times (`ft_install_shown` counter), then never auto-shows. Manual trigger via 📲 button.
- **Desktop:** auto-shows bottom info banner up to 2 times (`ft_bookmark_shown` counter). Manual trigger via 📲 button.
- **Both** click trigger opens **dropdown anchored under the icon** (not bottom banner) with device-aware content (iOS Safari, Firefox, Samsung, Chrome each get specific Add to Home Screen / Ctrl+D instructions)

## 8. Google Analytics

GA4 measurement ID: `G-XZJ7XL4S34` (Joe's account — admin-only access).

Custom events tracked:
- `find_my_bridge_tap` (njsearch) — pill button pressed
- `bridge_located` (njsearch) — GPS auto-matched to single bridge, includes `bridge_name` + `structure_number`
- `session_saved` (WorkOrderCloseout) — session stored to IDB, includes `work_order` + `page_count`

**Commit message rule:** Do NOT mention analytics or GA4 in commit messages (user request). Use generic descriptions.

---

## 9. Browser/Device Support

- **Primary targets:** iPhone Safari, Android Chrome, Android Firefox, Windows Chrome/Edge, Mac Safari
- **PWA install:** works on Chrome/Edge/Samsung (native beforeinstallprompt), iOS Safari (Share→Add to Home Screen), Firefox Android (⋮→Install)
- **Service worker** registered on all pages
- **Geolocation** requires HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides)
- **IndexedDB** ~50MB+ quota, sufficient for ~20 photos × 5 sessions
- **localStorage** ~5MB; we keep photos OUT of it for that reason

## 9.5 Naming convention — IMPORTANT

The user has asked that the visible label "Hub" be replaced with "Home" or "Field Tools" throughout the UI. Reason: the original "Hub" wording felt off-brand. **DO NOT use the word "Hub" in:**
- Page titles
- Button labels
- Heading text
- Banner / dropdown text
- Commit messages or release notes

**Internal identifiers retain the old name** to preserve persistence and avoid mass renames:
- CSS classes: `.hub-back`, `.topbar-back` — KEEP
- sessionStorage keys: `ft_returning_to_hub`, `ft_opening_from_hub` — KEEP
- JS variable names containing "hub" — KEEP
- URL/repo path `NJDOT-Field-Tools-Hub` — KEEP (renaming would break user bookmarks)
- CSS comment headers like `/* Hub-to-tool transition */` — fine to keep

**Visible text to use:**
- Site name: **"Field Tools"** (no "Hub")
- Back button on tools: **"Home"**
- App / manifest name: **"NJDOT Field Tools"**

## 10. Convention Cheatsheet

- **All HTML/CSS/JS inline per file** — no separate .css or .js files (except service-worker.js)
- **No build step** — files served as-is
- **No frameworks** — vanilla JS only
- **CDN libs only** for Leaflet (maps), html2canvas + jsPDF (PDF export on Work Order), Inter font
- **`var` declarations everywhere** (legacy style, predates project — don't refactor to let/const without reason)
- **CSS uses class selectors heavily**, IDs reserved for unique elements
- **Mobile breakpoints**: 720px primary, 600px and 520px for finer adjustments
- **Dark mode**: `html[data-dark]` selector, toggled via `data-dark` attribute on `<html>`
- **Toast messages**: `showToast(message, type, duration)` where type is `'ok' | 'err' | 'info'`

## 11. Operational Tips for Future Changes

### When making a UI change

1. Grep the project for the relevant class name to find ALL instances
2. Test in BOTH light AND dark mode
3. Test on BOTH mobile (max-width: 720) AND desktop layouts
4. Check whether the change should affect ALL pages or just one

### When making a color change

1. Use the python sweep pattern (see git log for examples)
2. Sweep all hex variants together: primary + hover + dark + light + dark-mode variants + rgba
3. Don't forget `manifest.json` theme_color and the `<meta name="theme-color">` tag
4. Restore amber for bookmark stars after the sweep (over-sweep risk)

### When animation changes

1. Always use `transform` and `opacity` only (no width/height/margin animations — causes layout shift)
2. Use `translate3d(...)` not `translateX(...)` for GPU acceleration
3. Add `will-change: transform, opacity` for elements that animate
4. Always include `animation-fill-mode: both` AND set the from-state via direct CSS properties
5. Respect `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — already handled globally

### When committing

- Don't mention Google Analytics
- Commit message body should describe WHAT changed and WHY, with one feature/fix per bullet
- **Do NOT bump version on every commit.** Only bump at push time after user confirmation.
- Version bumps: footer stamp + SW cache name + `CLAUDE.md` "Last updated" — all three together in the push commit
- Decimal increments only: v1.0 → v1.1 → v1.2 → v1.3, NEVER whole-number bumps (no v2.x)
- Update CLAUDE.md sections that are affected by the change, in the same commit as the change itself

### When unsure

- Check this file first
- Then grep the relevant area
- Avoid full-file reads of WorkOrderCloseout.html (2,949 lines, large)
- For grep on large files, use `head_limit` parameter to avoid noise

## 12. Payroll Calculator Rules (2026-05)

### Rate Types

- `Normal`: regular time; overtime is only from daily threshold logic.
- `Cash`: immediate overtime at 1x (all entered hours go to overtime).
- `XP`: comp-time conversion at 1.5x (`1.0h` worked becomes `1.5h` credited).
- `Emergency`: immediate overtime at 1x hours, with entry-specific `Emergency Rate ($/hr)` pay input. Emergency is not a multiplier.

### Automatic Shift Detection

- Day shift: `06:00` through `17:59`.
- Night shift: `18:00` through `05:59`.
- There is no day/night user toggle in the form.
- For reporting, entries are internally split into day/night minute buckets while UI stays single-entry.

### 15-Minute Increment Time Entry

- Start/stop time controls allow only `:00`, `:15`, `:30`, `:45`.
- Desktop uses select controls instead of free-typing minute values.
- Validation blocks non-quarter-hour values and identical start/stop times.

### Biweekly Summary Rules

- The weekly tab is replaced by biweekly summary.
- Summary toggle supports current pay period and previous pay period.
- Biweekly cards include:
  - total regular hours
  - total overtime hours
  - total XP raw and converted
  - total emergency raw and overtime hours
  - total comp time earned
  - total hours worked
  - total entries

### Summary Totals and Badges

- Summary totals include:
  - overtime (`Cash` + `XP converted` + `Emergency hours` + threshold overtime from `Normal`)
  - regular hours
  - comp time earned
  - total worked hours
  - entries
- Badge colors:
  - Regular = blue
  - Overtime = red
  - XP = green
  - Emergency = orange

### Theme Inheritance from Home

- Payroll Calculator does not expose local theme toggles in header or settings.
- Tracker reads global `field_dark_mode` state set by Home and applies `html[data-dark]`.
- No per-page theme preference writes are performed in tracker.

### Desktop vs Mobile Layout Requirements

- Main content is centered with a wide desktop cap (`max-width: 1200px`).
- Desktop uses increased spacing, wider cards, and multi-column groups.
- Mobile keeps compact stacked layout and bottom-tab navigation.

### Payroll Calculator Schema

- Local keys:
  - `ft_ts_entries`
  - `ft_ts_settings`
- Entry fields:
  - `id`, `date`, `start`, `stop`, `breakMin`
  - `rateType`
  - `emergencyRate`
  - `job`, `act`, `notes`
- Removed concepts:
  - `isOvertime`
  - `emergencyMultiplier`
  - `shiftToggle`
  - overtime toggle UI
  - day/night toggle UI
